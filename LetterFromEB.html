               <h2>LETTER FROM EB</h2>
               <br>
               <p>Honourable Delegates,

                It is a pleasure to welcome you to DA-IICT Model UN simulation. You are partaking in a fascinating committee whose work has grown in importance in the last decade, so much that it is now seen by some as a challenger to the Security Council. To that purpose, we have chosen a topic that has been inflaming the pas-sions of national leaders in recent months.
                
                As if that wasn’t exciting enough, we will not do so in a normal Model U.N. setting. You can forget everything you know about the normal rules of procedure. Instead, we will use an innovative approach to collective decision-making: the Consensus-Building Approach. This approach is based on negotiation theory, and seeks to foster a consensus between the negotiators by facilitating understanding and un-covering the interests of parties.
                
                You will learn more about this after reading the Background Guide. Next to that, we will hold a demo during the first two hours of session to get you acquainted with the process and provide you with a little training in negotiation – which differs a lot from normal MUN.
                
                We hope that you share our interest in experimenting this type of rules, and that you are as excited as we are to start building an agreement on the way forward for the global trading system. Enjoy reading this guide and let us know if you have any questions!
                
                Happy Researching
                Regards
                
                Udit Malik

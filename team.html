                    Known for his nerdiness and sense of humour, Vyom Saraf has a flair in getting things done. He loves football as much as he loves being a MUN-er. MUN-ing is what he loves the most. This conference is his brainchild and he will do whatever it takes to make DAMUNC reach heights. He works hard and will harangue others to do so too but he's a softie at the heart. Also, never argue with him because he'll win it anyway.
